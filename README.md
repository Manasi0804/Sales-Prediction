# Sales Data Prediction

##  Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales trends using **machine learning** techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, the model provides insights into demand forecasting and supports data-driven decision-making.

##  Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning with **Pandas & NumPy**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- Sales trend visualization and insights  
- Regression models for prediction (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Evaluation metrics for model performance  

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the sales dataset  
2. Perform data visualization and identify patterns  
3. Train ML models (Regression techniques)  
4. Evaluate models using accuracy metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)  
5. Predict future sales and visualize results  

##  Results
- The model successfully predicts sales with [XX% accuracy or RMSE value].  
- Identified seasonal/demand patterns useful for business decisions.  

##  Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models for time-series forecasting  
- Deploy as a web app with Flask/Streamlit  
- Automate pipeline for real-time sales prediction
